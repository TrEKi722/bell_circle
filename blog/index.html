                I'm sorry to say I knew this day would come. We are officially discontinuing schedules for Marco Foster Middle School. Using our analytics tools, we can tell it is not used often. Additionally, the schedules are hard to implement as there are separate schedules for sixth grade versus the other grades. If you would like to contact us about this feel free to shoot us an email at bellcircle@writeme.com or contact us through our <a href="../feedback">feedback forms</a>.

                Hi! I have been asked recently to put my name on the website, so I thought... why the heck not? So now you can see me on the about page. I've worked on this website for so long, so it is kinda nice to put my name somewhere.

                Hey! Just wanted to let all know what has been going on in my head recently, so here we go! My first official blog posting. <br>
                I recently decided to create this new version of the website, the main differences between the new one and the old one can be found here. I can tell you a couple of things though. I am getting into coding, so the schedules may continue to change and look different over time. A quick example of this is the new auto-change schedule, meaning the schedule will change to the current day for you. The change background button now changes the entire page's background (excluding the header banner of course), rather than changing a square in the middle of the page. That is all for now, please remember that I am in school too, so I am working hard around my homework.
